Adding sequences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the **Administrator interface**, the tool **Upload batch sequences/vouchers** allows you to upload DNA sequences into VoSeq. Along with the DNA sequences, you have to upload the required fields **gene code** and **voucher code**, optionalyl the primer names, laborator and creation date. Each sequence and its related data goes into one line, with fields separated by tabs. If you have your data in a spreadsheet such as MS Excel, you can copy and paste the data into the text area.

* It is important to use the same headers provided in the text area.
* It is also necessary that that the **code** of each sequence matches the **code** of voucher specimens that had been uploaded into VoSeq. This is the unique identifier that is used to connect the voucher data and their sequences.

(Aligned sequences should for best use of the database have missing data coded as questionmark (?) and gaps as a dash (-))

Adding vouchers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After successful installation, the first thing to do is to add records (vouchers,
or specimens). You can add a single record by going to the
**Administrator interface** and clicking on the link **Add new record**.

The most important information to enter is the **code** of voucher, which has to
be unique. VoSeq will refuse to accept duplicate codes and will issue error message
if this happens. Another necessary field is the **Genus** entry, while all other
fields are optional.

You can also upload a batch of records using the tool **Biological data»Vouchers»Import**.
You will be shown a page to batch-upload sequences. You will see instructions on
how to upload specimen data.
You can quickly import voucher data from a table in MS Excel by uploading the file
into VoSeq, provided that you use the right field headers.
A similar procedure can be executed for uploading batches of sequences.

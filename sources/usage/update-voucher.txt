Update voucher
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you **click on the code** of an already existing voucher in the **administrator interface** you will be transferred to it's **voucher information page**.

Here you may make changes to all the fields - and these will be updated after pressing **Update record**.

A changed **voucher code** will automaticly change the code in the connected fields for sequences and primer informations, so as to keep them connected.

There is also a **record history** displayed for administrators that list what changes have been made to the voucher information previously, with time and the user responsible for the changes.

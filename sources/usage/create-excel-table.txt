Create Excel table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can create a MS Excel table with specimen codes, genus and species names, genes used in analysis along with their accession numbers.

Go to the **User interface** and under the **Toolbox** click on the link **Create MS Excel table**

Instead of typing your specimen codes in the text area below, you could select a Taxonset (provided that it has been set before (:ref:`create_taxonset`).
This table will be ready to attach to a manuscript for publication.

You can also change the way sequence information is displayed in the table by choosing between **number of bases** (displays number of bases - does not count questionmarks **?**), **accession numbers** (displays stored accession numbers instead of sequence length) or **X/-** (displays **X** if sequence is present and **-** if sequence is missing.

**Display missing sequence beginnings/ends with star(*)?:** will show search for questionmarks (?) in the beginning or end of the sequences (when displayed by number of bases) and show if the sequence misses bases in those positions with an asterisk (*). Easy then to see during laboratory phase then where sequence information might be missing for your taxa.

You may also change between comma (,) and tab-delimited table mode.

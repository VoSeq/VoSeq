# This is a list of app names that can be used to generate docker files and ports
# so that we can run several Voseq installations in a single server without
# port or name conflicts.
# Write here the apps that you want to install in your single server.
# Run the script to regenerate such files (under the run folder) in case they
# get overwritten by updates to the Voseq repository.
#
# Usage:
# python generate_docker_files.py APP_NAME

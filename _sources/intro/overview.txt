VoSeq overview
--------------

With VoSeq you can keep data on your voucher specimens and DNA sequences in one
single place. Later on you can easily generate datasets ready for analysis in
phylogenetic software that use file formats such as NEXUS, Phylip, TNT, MEGA and
FASTA.
With a couple of clicks, you can request datasets partitioned by gene or codon
positions. You can also retrieve your dataset as aminoacid sequences or degenerated
nucleotides.

Here is a quick overview on how to use VoSeq with your data.

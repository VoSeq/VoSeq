Create taxonset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Taxonsets is a way to make a list of taxa that are being used for a specific project or analysis. A Taxonset is just a list of voucher codes. By having Taxonsets, you can quickly create datasets and tables for them.

If you have not set Taxonsets you will need to type specimen codes everytime you create a dataset. Instead, if you have a Taxonset for a particular project, you could select it when creating Tables for manuscripts.

Go to the **Administrator interface** and click on the link **Add/edit/view Taxon sets**.

A taxonset must have a name in order to be saved and usable later!

You can create a **Taxonset** by entering a list of specimen codes, each separated by a return:

Or by browsing the data in VoSeq and choosing the specimens you are interested in by marking them in the **X** field:

Here you can sort the table according to choosen information (taxonomic level, code, X-marked or not), as well as choose genes to display information of.
If you have choosen one or several genes, you can sort the table according to sequence availability for selected genes.
You can also press **mark all** or **unmark all** to add or remove X's to or from each taxa that are displayed (works well with filtering).
In order to perform a filtering or after selection of a new genecode you must press **Sort/Filter** to proceed. Your already marked taxa will be remembered.

After completing your selection of taxa and adding name and descriptions - press the **Add dataset** button to save it.
If you are updating an already existing taxonset - press **Update taxon set**.
